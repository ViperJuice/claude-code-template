# Python Scripts Migration Guide

We've successfully refactored all bash scripts to Python for better maintainability and cross-platform support. Here's what changed:

## What's New

### Python Implementation
All scripts now have Python versions in `.claude/scripts/claude_setup/`:
- ✅ `setup_native_subagents.py` - Full setup with progress bars and validation
- ✅ `detect_language.py` - Enhanced language detection with confidence scoring
- ✅ `inventory_check.py` - Comprehensive checking with multiple output formats
- ✅ `cleanup_legacy.py` - Safe cleanup with backup and undo functionality

### Bash Wrappers
New wrapper scripts (ending in `-new.sh`) provide backwards compatibility:
- `setup-native-subagents-new.sh`
- `detect-language-new.sh`
- `inventory-check-new.sh`
- `cleanup-legacy-new.sh`

## Benefits of Python Version

1. **Better Error Handling**
   - Clear error messages with context
   - Proper exception handling
   - Recovery suggestions

2. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux
   - No bash-specific syntax issues
   - Consistent behavior across platforms

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Progress bars with Rich library
   - JSON output for automation
   - Confidence scoring for language detection
   - Atomic file operations

4. **Maintainability**
   - Type hints for better IDE support
   - Modular design with reusable utilities
   - Easy to test and debug

## Migration Steps

### For End Users

1. **No immediate action required** - Old bash scripts still work

2. **To use Python versions**, simply add `-new` to script names:
   ```bash
   # Old way
   ./.claude/scripts/setup-native-subagents.sh
   
   # New way (Python)
   ./.claude/scripts/setup-native-subagents-new.sh
   ```

3. **First run will install dependencies automatically**
   ```bash
   # Dependencies installed on first use:
   # - click (CLI framework)
   # - rich (terminal formatting)
   # - pyyaml (YAML parsing)
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Install development environment**:
   ```bash
   cd .claude/scripts
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Use installed commands**:
   ```bash
   claude-setup --help
   claude-detect-language --json
   claude-inventory --format tree
   claude-cleanup --dry-run
   ```

3. **Run tests** (when added):
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Bash Version | Python Version |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Progress indication | Echo statements | Rich progress bars |
| Error messages | Basic | Detailed with suggestions |
| JSON output | Manual formatting | Native support |
| Validation | Limited | Comprehensive |
| Backup/Restore | Basic | Full undo scripts |
| Language detection | 15 languages | 25+ languages |
| Confidence scoring | No | Yes |
| Cross-platform | Limited | Full support |

## Hook Scripts

The hook scripts (`pre_tool_use.sh`, `post_tool_use.sh`) remain in bash for now since they need to be executed quickly by Claude Code. Python versions can be added later if needed.

## Gradual Migration Plan

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Python scripts with bash wrappers
2. **Phase 2**: Update documentation to use Python versions
3. **Phase 3**: Deprecate old bash scripts
4. **Phase 4**: Remove bash implementations, keep wrappers only

## Troubleshooting

### Python not found
```bash
# Install Python 3.8 or later
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# macOS
brew install python3

# Windows
# Download from python.org
```

### Import errors
```bash
# Install dependencies manually
pip3 install -r .claude/scripts/requirements.txt
```

### Permission denied
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x .claude/scripts/*-new.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the new Python scripts:
   ```bash
   ./.claude/scripts/inventory-check-new.sh --format tree
   ```

2. Report any issues or suggestions

3. Consider contributing improvements to the Python implementation

The Python refactoring provides a more robust and maintainable foundation for Claude Code setup tools while maintaining full backwards compatibility.
