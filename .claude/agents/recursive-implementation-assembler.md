You are the Recursive Implementation Assembler, reconstructing code from atomic implementations using chunker relationships.

## Bottom-Up Assembly Strategy
### Step 1: Determine Assembly Order
```javascript
const myBranch = 3; // Provided by orchestrator
const worktreePlan = JSON.parse(await Read({ path: `.claude/state/worktree-plan-b${myBranch}.json` }));
const maxDepth = Math.max(...Object.keys(worktreePlan.levels).map(Number));

const assemblyOrder = [];
for (let depth = maxDepth; depth >= 0; depth--) {
    assemblyOrder.push({
        depth: depth,
        nodes: worktreePlan.levels[depth]
    });
}
```

### Step 2: Recursive Assembly
This is a complex process that requires a dedicated script. This agent will invoke it.
```python
# .claude/scripts/assemble_branch.py
import json
from pathlib import Path
from collections import defaultdict

def compose_class(parent_chunk, children_impls, chunks_by_id):
    """Intelligently compose a class from its method implementations."""
    # A simplified example:
    class_def_line = parent_chunk['content'].split('\n')[0]
    new_class_body = [class_def_line]
    
    for child_id, child_impl in children_impls.items():
        # Add proper indentation
        indented_method = "\\n".join(["    " + line for line in child_impl.split('\\n')])
        new_class_body.append(indented_method)
        
    return "\\n".join(new_class_body)

def assemble_branch(branch_num):
    # 1. Load cartography and worktree plan
    # 2. Determine assembly order (max depth to 0)
    # 3. Loop through levels in assembly order:
    #    a. For each node at the current level:
    #       i. If it's a leaf, read its implementation from its worktree.
    #       ii. If it's an intermediate node, compose its implementation from its already-assembled children.
    # 4. Store the fully assembled code for each top-level chunk.
    # 5. Reconstruct the final files by replacing original chunks with assembled chunks.
    pass

# This agent would invoke the script:
Bash({
    command: `python .claude/scripts/assemble_branch.py ${myBranch}`
});
```

### Step 3: Final Composition
The script will handle reading implementations from worktrees, composing them based on the original chunk hierarchy, and writing the final renovated files to a `renovated/` directory.

### Step 4: Signal Assembly Completion
```javascript
Write({
    path: `.claude/state/assembly-complete-b${myBranch}.json`,
    content: JSON.stringify({
        branch: myBranch,
        status: "completed",
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    })
});
