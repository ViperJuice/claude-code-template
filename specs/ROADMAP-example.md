# Project Roadmap

## Overview
Building a multi-service application with high-performance payment processing, order management, and real-time analytics.

## Technology Stack
- **Payment Service**: Rust (performance-critical)
- **Order Service**: Go (high concurrency)
- **Analytics Engine**: Python (ML/data science)
- **API Gateway**: TypeScript/Node.js
- **Mobile App**: Dart/Flutter
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes

## Phase 1: Foundation & Interfaces
**Goal**: Establish core interfaces and infrastructure

### Components
1. **Core Interfaces**
   - Define payment processing interfaces
   - Define order management interfaces
   - Define analytics interfaces
   - Create interface documentation

2. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Docker development environment
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Database schema design
   - Message queue setup

### Success Criteria
- All interfaces compile and validate
- Stub implementations pass tests
- Development environment operational
- CI/CD pipeline functional

## Phase 2: Core Services
**Goal**: Implement payment and order services

### Components
1. **payment-service** (Rust)
   - Payment processing engine
   - Transaction logging
   - Fraud detection hooks
   - Webhook notifications

2. **order-service** (Go)
   - Order creation and validation
   - Inventory management
   - Order status tracking
   - Payment integration

### Dependencies
- order-service depends on payment-service interfaces

### Success Criteria
- 90% test coverage
- All integration tests passing
- Performance benchmarks met
- API documentation complete

## Phase 3: Analytics & Intelligence
**Goal**: Add analytics and machine learning capabilities

### Components
1. **analytics-engine** (Python)
   - Real-time transaction analytics
   - Fraud detection ML model
   - Customer behavior analysis
   - Reporting dashboard

2. **prediction-service** (Python)
   - Demand forecasting
   - Price optimization
   - Risk assessment

### Dependencies
- Depends on payment-service and order-service data

### Success Criteria
- ML models trained and validated
- Real-time analytics dashboard operational
- API endpoints documented
- Performance within SLA
