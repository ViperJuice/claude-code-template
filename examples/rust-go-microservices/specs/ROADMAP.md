# Rust + Go Microservices Roadmap

## Overview
Building a payment processing system with Rust for performance-critical payment handling and Go for high-concurrency order management.

## Phase 1: Core Services

### Components

1. **payment-service** (Rust)
   - Payment processing engine
   - Transaction validation
   - Fraud detection algorithms
   - Event publishing

2. **order-service** (Go)
   - Order creation and validation
   - Inventory checking
   - Payment service integration
   - Order status management

### Success Criteria
- Both services compile and run
- Unit tests pass with >80% coverage
- Integration tests verify communication
- API documentation complete

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features

### Components

1. **payment-service** enhancements
   - Add cryptocurrency support
   - Implement retry logic
   - Add detailed audit logging
   - Performance optimization

2. **order-service** enhancements
   - Batch order processing
   - Real-time order tracking
   - Webhook notifications
   - Rate limiting

### Dependencies
- Requires Phase 1 completion
- Shared event schema defined

## Phase 3: Production Readiness

### Components

1. **monitoring** (shared)
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Distributed tracing
   - Health check endpoints
   - Performance dashboards

2. **deployment**
   - Docker containers
   - Kubernetes manifests
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Load testing

### Success Criteria
- Services handle 10K requests/second
- 99.9% uptime SLA achievable
- Automated deployment working
- Monitoring alerts configured
