# C++ Engine with Multi-Language Bindings Roadmap

## Overview
Building a high-performance mathematical computation engine in C++ with enterprise Java wrapper and data science Python bindings.

## Phase 1: Core Engine

### Components

1. **engine** (C++)
   - Basic matrix operations (add, multiply, transpose)
   - Vector operations
   - Memory management
   - C API for bindings

2. **java-wrapper** (Java)
   - JNI bindings
   - Java-friendly API
   - Maven package structure
   - Basic thread safety

3. **python-bindings** (Python/Cython)
   - Python C API bindings
   - NumPy array support
   - Basic operations wrapper
   - Setup.py packaging

### Success Criteria
- All components compile
- Basic operations work across languages
- Memory safety verified
- Unit tests pass

## Phase 2: Advanced Features

### Components

1. **engine** enhancements
   - Statistical functions
   - Linear algebra operations
   - SIMD optimizations
   - GPU support preparation

2. **java-wrapper** enhancements
   - Spring Boot starter
   - Async operations
   - Connection pooling
   - Performance monitoring

3. **python-bindings** enhancements
   - Pandas DataFrame support
   - Scikit-learn compatible interface
   - Jupyter magic commands
   - Parallel processing

### Dependencies
- BLAS/LAPACK for linear algebra
- OpenMP for parallelization

## Phase 3: Production Features

### Components

1. **performance**
   - GPU acceleration (CUDA/OpenCL)
   - Distributed computing support
   - Memory-mapped operations
   - Benchmark suite

2. **integration**
   - Docker images for each language
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Package publishing (PyPI, Maven Central)
   - Documentation generation

### Success Criteria
- 100x performance vs pure Python
- Published packages
- Comprehensive documentation
- Production deployments
